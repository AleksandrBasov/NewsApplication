# NewsApplication

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Aleksandr. I'm glad to see you on my [GitHub](https://github.com/AleksandrBasov?tab=repositories).

## Features

The application is developed in Swift language. I used MVVM architecture in my project.

In this application, I used the PanModal framework for beautiful Onboarding.

SearchBar, CollectionView and TableView are located on the main screen. CollectionView is intended for sorting news into categories, TableView for displaying news.

I also used the Realm framework to save news so that they could be read without the Internet.

If you do not have an Internet connection, then you will be shown an Alert from which you can go to the settings or just close it.

Clicking on a cell in the TableView will take you to Safari. Have a nice day and enjoy my application.
